# Image Noise Remover Tool

A MATLAB-based tool that applies frequency domain filtering to reduce noise in images and visualize the Fourier Transform process.  
It provides interactive control over the filter radius, enabling users to fine-tune the balance between noise reduction and detail preservation.

## üìñ Description

The **Image Noise Remover Tool** leverages Fourier Transform techniques to process images in the frequency domain.  
It allows applying low-pass and high-pass filters to either remove noise or extract fine details from images.  
It also supports visualization of key steps: grayscale conversion, Fourier magnitude computation, frequency shifting, and filtering results.

## üöÄ Features

- Convert color images into grayscale for easier processing.
- Visualize the Fourier Transform and shifted spectra.
- Apply custom radius-based **low-pass** and **high-pass** filters.
- Add artificial noise (Salt & Pepper) to test filtering performance.
- Use digital median filtering for additional noise removal.
- Display results step-by-step using organized subplots.
- Interactive user inputs for custom filter radius selection.
- Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT): To transform the frequency domain into the original image

**Colorful Image**: The original color image used as the starting input for processing. <br>
**Grayscale Image**: Converted version of the original image into grayscale to simplify frequency processing. <br>
**Fourier Magnitude Image**: Visualization of the Fourier Transform magnitude of the grayscale image, representing frequency components. <br>
**Shifted Fourier Magnitude Image**: Shifted version of the Fourier Transform to center the low frequencies, making filters more intuitive. <br>
**Low-pass Filter**: A frequency filter that allows low-frequency components to pass while blocking high frequencies (noise). <br>
**Low-pass Filtered Image**: Image after applying the low-pass filter, showing noise reduction while preserving general structures. <br>
**High-pass Filter**: A filter that allows high-frequency components (fine details and edges) to pass while blocking the lower frequencies. <br>
**High-pass Filtered Image**: Image after applying the high-pass filter, highlighting edges and fine features. <br>
